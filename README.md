# IBM Model 60/80 Floppy Cover STL Model
This is a recreation of the cover for the floppys with card edge connectors for the IBM Model 60 and Model 80.
I believe it's the IBM FRU # 72X8550.

I have provided both an original recreation and also a reinforced one since the tabs are a little to brittle when printed with a FDM-printer.

## Settings
This is a little tricky to print. I printed with front side up and supports which worked when using the reinforced version.
